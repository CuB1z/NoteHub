        "NoteHub was born from a simple need: to access our Obsidian notes from anywhere, without depending on a local setup. By using GitHub as a storage base, we realized we could make that happen‚Äîwithout sacrificing privacy or usability.",
        "Before building NoteHub, we used to organize our university notes on Notion. We even created a site called NotionLovers (https://notionlovers.vercel.app/), focused on academic notes in Spanish. However, over time we saw Obsidian as a more flexible and developer-friendly option.",
        "That shift led us to imagine a tool not tied to any single platform or technology. That's when NoteHub was born: an open, Markdown-powered platform to explore your knowledge freely."

        "At NoteHub, we believe in giving users complete freedom. That's why we don't rely on any specific tech stack or proprietary formats‚Äîif it's Markdown, NoteHub can render it.",
        "We also believe your workspace should feel right to you. That's why we offer customizable themes so you can choose a style that fits your taste: dark, light, minimal, vibrant‚Äîyou're in control.",
        "Privacy matters too. You can safely connect private GitHub repositories without storing your notes anywhere else. Your notes remain yours‚Äîsecure and private."

      paragraphs: [
        "NoteHub is a living project. While there are still many ideas we want to implement, you can already explore, share, and customize your Markdown notes easily.",
        "We openly welcome contributions on GitHub. Whether it's feedback, ideas, or direct collaboration, the community is always invited. We believe in building openly and iterating together.",
        "Right now, the interface is available in English, but we are gradually expanding to support more languages‚Äîstarting with Spanish, a big part of our roots."
