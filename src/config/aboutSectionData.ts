      "NoteHub was created to solve a simple but real problem: accessing our Obsidian notes from anywhere, without being tied to a specific device or setup. By leveraging GitHub as a secure and reliable storage backend, we made it possible to sync, edit, and browse your notes seamlessly‚Äîwhile keeping privacy and usability at the forefront.",
      "Our journey started with organizing university notes on Notion, even launching NotionLovers (https://notionlovers.vercel.app/) to help Spanish-speaking students. Over time, though, we realized Obsidian offered a more open and developer-friendly approach, giving us the flexibility we were looking for.",
      "This evolution inspired us to build NoteHub: a platform that isn't locked to any ecosystem, format, or vendor. Powered by Markdown and open standards, NoteHub lets you truly own and explore your knowledge, your way."
